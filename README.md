### Hi, my name is Juan Cruz ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ“±

Welcome to personal repository.
I graduated as Image and Sound Designer at the University of Buenos Aires in 2019.
The pandemic was a turning point, with more free time I began to explore new paths.
In 2021 I decided to investigate the world of UX-UI Design, which then led me in early 2022 to study JavaScript and currently Swift, especially SwiftUI.


```swift

import Foundation

struct Bio {
    let name: String = "Juan Cruz"
    var age: Int = 27
    var location : String = "Buenos Aires, Argentina"
    
    }
    
    
class skill {
    var lenguages = ["Swift", "JavaScript"] 
    var framework = ["SwiftUI", "Objetive-C", "Bootstrap" ] 
}    

```
